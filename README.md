## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## A short story

I started to design this site with the idea of making it a single page CV with some transition animations. After pushing a "working demo" to GitHub, I stopped working on it. Fast-forward couple of months, I ran into Lee Robinson's personal site while trying to learn Server Actions from YouTube. The simplicity of its design brought back the energy for me to design my CV similarly. As a result, the overall style of this is heavily inspired by his site.

## Future Plans

- [ ] I want to ideally integrate Notion to link my writings on things I learn about or hobbies/interest stuff.
- [ ] Include a feature to make my CV downloadable.
