# About Me

I have over two years of experience, primarily specializing in Python and backend API development. Throughout my career so far,
I have played a key role in developing systems that replace manual processes, such as a bank’s loan application and approval system
and a government’s grant distribution program.

With a strong foundation in Python and Django, I have focused on building robust API-based systems and integrating them with front-end
technologies like React. I am passionate about continuously learning and exploring new technologies through personal projects,
and I am actively seeking opportunities that challenge me to solve real-world problems while growing as a developer.

I enjoy working on projects that push the boundaries of my skill set and allow me to integrate modern tools such as FastAPI, Kubernetes,
and Redis. I’m excited about applying these skills in a professional environment where I can contribute to impactful solutions.

## Personal Projects

### Fantasy Premier League Data Dashboard

I am developing a web app that consumes the Fantasy Premier League API to extract and display player data on a Next.js front end. FastAPI is used to handle API consumption, while Redis optimizes data validation and minimizes database actions. A cron job schedules the API calls, and the app is hosted locally using Kubernetes.

**Tech stack:** FastAPI, Next.js, Pydantic, Postgres, SQLAlchemy, Psycopg, Kubernetes, Cron Jobs, Redis

### Job Scraping and Listing Platform

I am building a job scraping tool that collects job listings from multiple online sources. The backend, written in Python using Scrapy, handles scraping and data processing, while the frontend, built with React, displays the job details like title, company, and requirements.

**Tech stack:** Python, Scrapy, React
