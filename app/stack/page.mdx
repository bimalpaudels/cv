# Language

I love working with Python as backend. Javascript/Typescript

Django, FastAPI, some express, Nextjs

Postgres is the main one. Have built a recent interest in NoSql databases and looked into Cassandra.

# AI

### ChatGPT, deepL, v0

These tools have influenced the way I use web these days. ChatGPT will get questions ranging from "Suggest me 100 alternate names
for the blog section of my website" to "...". I use deepL exclusively for translating and it is pretty amazing at it. Lastly,
v0 is amazingly good at helping me debug Typescript related issues in components.

# Tools

K8s, Notion, Docker, Redis
